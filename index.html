							<h2>Santorini, Greece</h2>
							<a href="images/fulls/01.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://world-visits.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Santorini-Greece-9-500x313.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<p>Santorini really isn't like the rest of the world - it's much brighter and joyful. This island may well have conquered the edge of your imagination, with bright blue candy-colored houses that match nicely with the whitewashed walls, meant to represent the colors of the Greek flag. Santorini is what remains of a huge volcanic eruption that destroyed the earliest settlements, an island in the middle of the blue sparkling sapphire waters of the Mediterranean, with colorful pumice cliffs that rise above a beautiful caldera. Santorini is best known for it's beautiful sunset, which glows radiantly with different tints, and the wines and olives produced. </p>

							<h2>Bigar Waterfall, Romania</h2>
							<a href="images/fulls/07.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/155503-Bigar-Waterfall-Romania.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<p>The waterfall at Ivorzul BigÄƒr is one of the most beautiful in the world. Though not as large as Niagra or Yosemite falls, this place is a hidden paradise. The sparkling, clear blue water that flows onto green rocks almost seems to glow luminously, resembling what seems to come out of a fairytale. There is a legend that describes a peasant family who goes to seek a witch because they bore no kids, but it is possibly made up to attract more tourists.

							<h2>Venice, Italy</h2>
							<a href="images/fulls/08.jpg" class="image"><img src="http://ffaasstt.swide.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/top-10-most-romantic-things-to-do-in-venice.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<p>Venice, a city with an amazing romantic atmosphere, is definitely one of the top places to travel to before you die. With its grand marble palaces rising out of the water, gondolas, canals, travelling through Venice is just like travelling through a painting. Venice is simply a city unlike any other. The canal snakes through the city, gleaming with sunlight. There are no roads or highways in Venice. The only way to get around is by boat, as the area is built over 100 small islands on a lagoon.
